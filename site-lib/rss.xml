These contracts usually arise when a human damages Faery property, insults a Fae, or voluntarily seeks Fae aid. The bargain is always transactional: the Fae demand service, action, or knowledge in return for balance.Humans who enter a deal pledge their soul as collateral, ensuring the Fae’s terms cannot be refused without consequence. Unlike a Geis, a deal does not leave a visible mark, but its weight binds the debtor until the service is fully repaid.Common Features of Deals:
Always transactional: service or action is exchanged for balance. Collateral is the debtor’s soul or essence. Duration varies; some debts last days, others may endure for a lifetime. Breaking the bargain strengthens the Fae’s claim over the human.

The town serves as the birthplace and home of Naomi Castro and her family, and it is one of the known crossing points into Faery due to the presence of Gaspar’s domain.Founded in 1866 by European settlers and local families, Santa Marta has remained relatively isolated, preserving both natural landscapes and long-standing traditions. The town is surrounded by thick pine and native Patagonian forests, which stretch directly toward the Atlantic coastline.The dual landscape of forest and shore has fueled local folklore and superstitions for generations. Stories of strange lights, inexplicable winds, and sudden disappearances are common, often linked by locals to “las hadas” and other folkloric creatures.
1866 – Foundation: Santa Marta was established as a small fishing and logging community. Families of Spanish, Italian, and criollo descent built homes along the coast and cleared sections of the forest. Late 1800s: Oral histories describe unusual events following the town’s founding, including unexplained illnesses, accidents near thorn groves, and tales of a “green man” said to wander the woods. This period coincides with the death of Gaspar, who later reappears in Faery as part of the Gentry. 20th Century: While modern infrastructure reached Santa Marta, it has remained small and largely dependent on fishing, tourism, and small-scale farming. The woods and beach continue to be considered liminal spaces by locals, and warnings against cutting certain trees or disturbing mushrooms persist. Santa Marta is a significant location within the narrative due to its connection to Gaspar’s domain. The Castro family has lived in the town for generations, unknowingly residing close to active fairy sites.
Gaspar’s Domain: Located in the deeper forest beyond the main town, tied to roots, thorns, and mushroom circles. Crossing Points: Liminal areas such as the beach at night, storm winds, and mushroom clusters act as weak spots between Earth and Faery. Local Lore: Families often tell children not to wander at dusk or whistle near the forest edge, traditions rooted in faint memories of Faery contact. <br><a data-href="Naomi" href="lore/characters/naomi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Naomi</a> Castro: Protagonist of the series, resident of Santa Marta and current debtor to Gaspar.

Santa Marta, Rio NegroThe&nbsp;Fae&nbsp;are an umbrella term for beings of Fae nature, native to or dwelling within the inner physical plane of Earth, known to humans as&nbsp;FaeryThey are long-lived or immortal beings with a natural affinity for magic, perception, and manipulation of their environment.Fae vary widely in form, temperament, and power, ranging from diminutive, elusive tricksters to towering, noble entities. Many are bound to natural or mystical features such as forests, rivers, or stone circles, and they often interact with the human world in secretive or enigmatic ways.Most fae live far longer than humans, and some are effectively immortal. Lifespan varies depending on type and origin.Fae frequently make bargains with humans or other fae. Compensation is usually labor, services, or information, with the soul sometimes serving as collateral if terms are broken.Many fae can weave glamour, altering human perception of themselves, their surroundings, or objects. This can include appearing more beautiful, hiding hazards, or creating entire illusory landscapes.Fae can place curses or bestow blessings, often following the rules of the bargain or geasa. These effects can be subtle or extreme and may manifest physically, mentally, or socially.Most fae can move between the mortal realm and Faery, often through natural thresholds, liminal times, or hidden portals. Travel can be restricted by geography, time, or magical barriers.Some fae can assume alternative forms, usually humanoid, animal, or semi-animal. Others can manifest objects, lights, or natural phenomena to influence or test humans.Fae often perceive truths invisible to humans, including intentions, bargains, or magical presence. They can sense emotional states, spiritual energy, or disturbances in the natural order.Many fae have a connection to natural forces, enabling them to manipulate plants, weather, water, or animals within their domain, often as a reflection of their mood or whims.FaeThe human race is an intelligent life form native to Earth's outer physical plane.They are a highly adaptable species, capable of surviving in a wide range of environments. Humans possess no inherent magical traits, relying instead on ingenuity, collaboration, and technological or cultural advancement.Humans are known for their curiosity, resilience, and restlessness, often pushing beyond their limits in search of knowledge, power, or exploration. Though not the strongest or the most gifted species, their adaptability makes them one of the most influential and widespread peoples of their world.HumansA&nbsp;Geis&nbsp;(Plural form: Gaesa) is a pact formed between a Fae and a human, in exchange for hidden knowledge orthe ownership of physical objects from&nbsp;FaeryIt shows itself as a tattoo over the heart of the human who makes the pact. Unlike ordinary bargains, a Geis imposes specific conditions that, if broken, can result in harm or death. Geasa often leave a visible or magical mark on the person bound, serving as a permanent reminder of the agreement and its restrictions.These pacts are frequently used to protect secrets, enforce loyalty, or ensure compliance with the fae’s instructions. The knowledge or promises obtained through a Geis are considered sacred; revealing or boasting about them is dangerous and can trigger the pact’s consequences. Geasa are highly individualized, reflecting the will and nature of the fae who impose them. They are not easily removed or broken, and the terms are usually clear only to those who enter into them.The mark may appear on the skin, sometimes glowing, shifting, or forming symbolic shapes related to the terms of the pact. The location and appearance often reflect the nature of the obligation.Violating the conditions of a Geis can result in immediate physical or magical repercussions, ranging from pain, illness, to death in extreme cases.Some Geasa impose compulsions, enhancing the subject’s focus on fulfilling the terms or deterring disclosure of forbidden information. However, this compulsion can be bypassed, which usually leads to baneful effects of the Geis.The pact is manifested physically by a small flower tattoo that appears on the chest of the human, over their heart.GeisMagicThe Outer Physical Plane of Earth is the material world inhabited primarily by the Human race and other non-magical beings. It is the visible, tangible layer of the planet, encompassing continents, oceans, skies, and all ecosystems familiar to mortals.While magic exists in traces here, it is not inherent to most native species. The Outer Plane is defined by its physical laws and predictable cycles, from the rising and setting of the sun to the changing of seasons. Though connected to the inner plane known as Faery, this layer is largely imperceptible to Fae unless they choose to reveal themselves.Humans are the dominant intelligent species here, shaping the world through culture, technology, and adaptation, yet the Outer Plane remains wild in many regions, hinting at the mysteries and powers that lie just beyond mortal perception.Outer Physical PlaneThe Inner Physical Plane, Also Known as Faery, is the hidden land native to the Fae and its subspecies. Is Geographically is identical to the outer plane.Inner Physical Plane (Faery)Argentina<br><img alt="Maria.png" src="images/maria.png" target="_self">Maria<br><img alt="Lucas.png" src="images/lucas.png" target="_self">Lucas<br><a data-href="Gentry" href="lore/races/gentry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gentry</a>Earth is a terrestrial planet located in the Milky Way galaxy.

Their appearance depends on each individual and whether the Gentry is a reincarnated human, appearing as a young adult or middle-aged person.Like many members of the Fae, the Gentry is capable of making deals with humans or other Fae.

They are among the earliest intelligent fae to appear, embodying both curiosity and mischief.They originated from the Intelligence era of&nbsp;FaeryThey possess minor magical abilities, often tied to illusion, glamours, and influencing emotions, and are strongly associated with liminal spaces such as hedgerows, crossroads, and forest edges. Their behavior toward humans ranges from friendly and helpful to mischievous, depending on how they are treated.Pixies stand between 60–80 cm tall, with an androgynous build. Their skin and eyes are a vivid green, and their hair is always short, white, and cut close to the head in a style reminiscent of the “pixie cut.”Their ears are sharply pointed, and their features carry a lively, mischievous gleam.Pixies always have monosyllabic names.Unlike many fae, Pixies have no sense of sexuality, gender, modesty, or dress codes.Offering or forcing clothing upon them is considered a grave insult—one of the quickest ways to make an enemy of a Pixie.Pixies]]></description><link>index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Index.canvas</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 23:01:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="images/maria.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/maria.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Santa Marta, Rio Negro]]></title><description><![CDATA[Santa Marta is a small coastal town located in Río Negro, Argentina, notable for its unique geography of dense forests adjoining a sandy beach.

Fae and a human, in exchange for hidden knowledge orthe ownership of physical objects from&nbsp;FaeryIt shows itself as a tattoo over the heart of the human who makes the pact. Unlike ordinary bargains, a Geis imposes specific conditions that, if broken, can result in harm or death. Geasa often leave a visible or magical mark on the person bound, serving as a permanent reminder of the agreement and its restrictions.These pacts are frequently used to protect secrets, enforce loyalty, or ensure compliance with the fae’s instructions. The knowledge or promises obtained through a Geis are considered sacred; revealing or boasting about them is dangerous and can trigger the pact’s consequences. Geasa are highly individualized, reflecting the will and nature of the fae who impose them. They are not easily removed or broken, and the terms are usually clear only to those who enter into them.The mark may appear on the skin, sometimes glowing, shifting, or forming symbolic shapes related to the terms of the pact. The location and appearance often reflect the nature of the obligation.Violating the conditions of a Geis can result in immediate physical or magical repercussions, ranging from pain, illness, to death in extreme cases.Some Geasa impose compulsions, enhancing the subject’s focus on fulfilling the terms or deterring disclosure of forbidden information. However, this compulsion can be bypassed, which usually leads to baneful effects of the Geis.The pact is manifested physically by a small flower tattoo that appears on the chest of the human, over their heart.]]></description><link>lore/magic/geis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lore/Magic/Geis.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 19:00:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inner Physical Plane (Faery)]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Inner Physical Plane, Also Known as Faery, is the hidden land native to the Fae and its subspecies.

It is the visible, tangible layer of the planet, encompassing continents, oceans, skies, and all ecosystems familiar to mortals.While magic exists in traces here, it is not inherent to most native species. The Outer Plane is defined by its physical laws and predictable cycles, from the rising and setting of the sun to the changing of seasons. Though connected to the inner plane known as Faery, this layer is largely imperceptible to Fae unless they choose to reveal themselves.Humans are the dominant intelligent species here, shaping the world through culture, technology, and adaptation, yet the Outer Plane remains wild in many regions, hinting at the mysteries and powers that lie just beyond mortal perception.]]></description><link>lore/world/outer-physical-plane.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lore/World/Outer Physical Plane.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 18:53:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Earth]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earth is a terrestrial planet located in the Milky Way galaxy.

Many are bound to natural or mystical features such as forests, rivers, or stone circles, and they often interact with the human world in secretive or enigmatic ways.Most fae live far longer than humans, and some are effectively immortal. Lifespan varies depending on type and origin.Fae frequently make bargains with humans or other fae. Compensation is usually labor, services, or information, with the soul sometimes serving as collateral if terms are broken.Many fae can weave glamour, altering human perception of themselves, their surroundings, or objects. This can include appearing more beautiful, hiding hazards, or creating entire illusory landscapes.Fae can place curses or bestow blessings, often following the rules of the bargain or geasa. These effects can be subtle or extreme and may manifest physically, mentally, or socially.Most fae can move between the mortal realm and Faery, often through natural thresholds, liminal times, or hidden portals. Travel can be restricted by geography, time, or magical barriers.Some fae can assume alternative forms, usually humanoid, animal, or semi-animal. Others can manifest objects, lights, or natural phenomena to influence or test humans.Fae often perceive truths invisible to humans, including intentions, bargains, or magical presence. They can sense emotional states, spiritual energy, or disturbances in the natural order.Many fae have a connection to natural forces, enabling them to manipulate plants, weather, water, or animals within their domain, often as a reflection of their mood or whims.]]></description><link>lore/races/fae.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lore/Races/Fae.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 18:53:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pixies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pixies are a species of the Fae, characterized by their small stature, quick movements, and inherently playful, though sometimes troublesome, nature. They are among the earliest intelligent fae to appear, embodying both curiosity and mischief.They originated from the Intelligence era of&nbsp;FaeryThey possess minor magical abilities, often tied to illusion, glamours, and influencing emotions, and are strongly associated with liminal spaces such as hedgerows, crossroads, and forest edges. Their behavior toward humans ranges from friendly and helpful to mischievous, depending on how they are treated.Pixies stand between 60–80 cm tall, with an androgynous build. Their skin and eyes are a vivid green, and their hair is always short, white, and cut close to the head in a style reminiscent of the “pixie cut.”Their ears are sharply pointed, and their features carry a lively, mischievous gleam.Pixies always have monosyllabic names.Unlike many fae, Pixies have no sense of sexuality, gender, modesty, or dress codes.Offering or forcing clothing upon them is considered a grave insult—one of the quickest ways to make an enemy of a Pixie.]]></description><link>lore/races/pixies.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Lore/Races/Pixies.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 18:49:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Humans]]></title><description><![CDATA[The human race is an intelligent life form native to Earth's outer physical plane.They are a highly adaptable species, capable of surviving in a wide range of environments.
