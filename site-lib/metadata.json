Geasa often leave a visible or magical mark on the person bound, serving as a permanent reminder of the agreement and its restrictions.These pacts are frequently used to protect secrets, enforce loyalty, or ensure compliance with the fae’s instructions.

These contracts usually arise when a human damages Faery property, insults a Fae, or voluntarily seeks Fae aid. The bargain is always transactional: the Fae demand service, action, or knowledge in return for balance.Humans who enter a deal pledge their soul as collateral, ensuring the Fae’s terms cannot be refused without consequence. Unlike a Geis, a deal does not leave a visible mark, but its weight binds the debtor until the service is fully repaid.Common Features of Deals:\nAlways transactional: service or action is exchanged for balance. Collateral is the debtor’s soul or essence. Duration varies; some debts last days, others may endure for a lifetime. Breaking the bargain strengthens the Fae’s claim over the human.\nDeal100000 BCE to 80000 BCEIntelligent Fae creatures started appearing, varying in size.

Many are bound to natural or mystical features such as forests, rivers, or stone circles, and they often interact with the human world in secretive or enigmatic ways.Most fae live far longer than humans, and some are effectively immortal. Lifespan varies depending on type and origin.Fae frequently make bargains with humans or other fae. Compensation is usually labor, services, or information, with the soul sometimes serving as collateral if terms are broken.Many fae can weave glamour, altering human perception of themselves, their surroundings, or objects. This can include appearing more beautiful, hiding hazards, or creating entire illusory landscapes.Fae can place curses or bestow blessings, often following the rules of the bargain or geasa. These effects can be subtle or extreme and may manifest physically, mentally, or socially.Most fae can move between the mortal realm and Faery, often through natural thresholds, liminal times, or hidden portals. Travel can be restricted by geography, time, or magical barriers.Some fae can assume alternative forms, usually humanoid, animal, or semi-animal. Others can manifest objects, lights, or natural phenomena to influence or test humans.Fae often perceive truths invisible to humans, including intentions, bargains, or magical presence. They can sense emotional states, spiritual energy, or disturbances in the natural order.Many fae have a connection to natural forces, enabling them to manipulate plants, weather, water, or animals within their domain, often as a reflection of their mood or whims.FaeThe human race is an intelligent life form native to Earth's outer physical plane.They are a highly adaptable species, capable of surviving in a wide range of environments. Humans possess no inherent magical traits, relying instead on ingenuity, collaboration, and technological or cultural advancement.Humans are known for their curiosity, resilience, and restlessness, often pushing beyond their limits in search of knowledge, power, or exploration. Though not the strongest or the most gifted species, their adaptability makes them one of the most influential and widespread peoples of their world.HumansA&nbsp;Geis&nbsp;(Plural form: Gaesa) is a pact formed between a Fae and a human, in exchange for hidden knowledge orthe ownership of physical objects from&nbsp;FaeryIt shows itself as a tattoo over the heart of the human who makes the pact. Unlike ordinary bargains, a Geis imposes specific conditions that, if broken, can result in harm or death. Geasa often leave a visible or magical mark on the person bound, serving as a permanent reminder of the agreement and its restrictions.These pacts are frequently used to protect secrets, enforce loyalty, or ensure compliance with the fae’s instructions. The knowledge or promises obtained through a Geis are considered sacred; revealing or boasting about them is dangerous and can trigger the pact’s consequences. Geasa are highly individualized, reflecting the will and nature of the fae who impose them. They are not easily removed or broken, and the terms are usually clear only to those who enter into them.The mark may appear on the skin, sometimes glowing, shifting, or forming symbolic shapes related to the terms of the pact. The location and appearance often reflect the nature of the obligation.Violating the conditions of a Geis can result in immediate physical or magical repercussions, ranging from pain, illness, to death in extreme cases.Some Geasa impose compulsions, enhancing the subject’s focus on fulfilling the terms or deterring disclosure of forbidden information. However, this compulsion can be bypassed, which usually leads to baneful effects of the Geis.The pact is manifested physically by a small flower tattoo that appears on the chest of the human, over their heart.GeisMagicThe Outer Physical Plane of Earth is the material world inhabited primarily by the Human race and other non-magical beings.

They may be born in Faery or reincarnated there after death.They possess innate magical abilities and a strong connection to the Otherworld, though their personalities and intentions toward humans vary widely—from curious and playful to distant or mischievous.The Gentry are indistinguishable from humans in their prime; a key distinguishing feature of the Gentry is their pointed ears, setting them apart from mortals and many other Fae.On their native plane, they appear with natural human coloring, but when seen by humans on the Outer physical plane, they manifest a faint green glow, pale skin, and an overall greenish hue.Like many members of the Fae, Gentry enjoy eternal life once they reach adulthood. Their appearance depends on each individual and whether the Gentry is a reincarnated human, appearing as a young adult or middle-aged person.Like many members of the Fae, the Gentry is capable of making deals with humans or other Fae. These deals are usually paid for with physical or intellectual labor, with the soul of the other party serving as collateral in case the deal cannot be repaid.<br>See&nbsp;<a data-href=\"Geis\" href=\"lore/magic/geis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Geis</a>\nIn exchange for hidden knowledge, the Gentry can mark the human with a mark on the chest, this mark can cause pain or death to the human if they reveal knowledge given by a member of the gentry to other humans.With Glamour Magic, they can change the perception that humans have of them and/or their domains.GentryPixies are a species of the Fae, characterized by their small stature, quick movements, and inherently playful, though sometimes troublesome, nature. They are among the earliest intelligent fae to appear, embodying both curiosity and mischief.They originated from the Intelligence era of&nbsp;FaeryThey possess minor magical abilities, often tied to illusion, glamours, and influencing emotions, and are strongly associated with liminal spaces such as hedgerows, crossroads, and forest edges. Their behavior toward humans ranges from friendly and helpful to mischievous, depending on how they are treated.Pixies stand between 60–80 cm tall, with an androgynous build. Their skin and eyes are a vivid green, and their hair is always short, white, and cut close to the head in a style reminiscent of the “pixie cut.”Their ears are sharply pointed, and their features carry a lively, mischievous gleam.Pixies always have monosyllabic names.Unlike many fae, Pixies have no sense of sexuality, gender, modesty, or dress codes.Offering or forcing clothing upon them is considered a grave insult—one of the quickest ways to make an enemy of a Pixie.Pixies","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Gentry
